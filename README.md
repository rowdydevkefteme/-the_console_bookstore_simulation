#How to build it from sources:

2- Download the CMake from the official website for your platform


3 - Enter the directory with cloned repo


`cd -the_console_bookstore_simulation/bookstore`


4 - Create a build direcotry and enter it


`mkdir build && cd build`
5 - Run the CMake


`cmake ..`
6 - Run the building process


CMake will build a Makefile or file with some IDE project, for example if you use Windows + Visual Studio cmake will generate .sln file which is configured project file for the Visual Studio, if you use
Linux - cmake will generate a Makefile by default. 


For example, if CMake generated a Makefile, just run:


`make`


If it generated .sln file - just open it using Visual Studio and run: Build->Build Solution
